### Project Description
For our Final Project we handled a dataset from the NYC Open Data website containing historical data on 911 Calls in New York as well as data from a NYC 2010 census. Our analysis focuses primarily on the risk factors associated with criminal activities. Specifically, we have looked at three main factors that affect the number of crime reports in New York. First we looked at Geography and how different trends are observed in each Borough of NY. In this section of our analysis we included a bar graph, scatter plot maps, and interactive heat maps visualizing how criminal activity varies across boroughs. We then looked at Location to try to detect any trends associated with the location of the incident. Specifically, we looked at the different premises that each crime has been reported to have occured which gave us an understainding of whihc premises tend to be more "denagerous." Thirdly, we explored Seasonality and how the number of crime reports change over the year and throughout the day. We used line graphs and bar graphs to visualize our findings.
